# Hi, I'm Sacha ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“š I'm currently working on a learning hub for experimenting with novel use cases with non-fungible assets on [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/). Check it out [here](https://polkadot-nfts-learning-hub.vercel.app/). 

I'm an avid explorer for building with emerging web3 tech. I'm also a Developer Advocate at Parity Technologies where I do things like curate our external [developer newsletter](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/newsletter), co-host a livestream called [Substrate Seminar](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-seminar), documentation and learning material to help others build on Polkadot.
